My research centers on integration of computer science text analysis and visualization software with qualitative methodologies for social science research. This work has focused on news media and social media texts. I am entering a graduate program in human geography, and am thus interested in attending this critical GIS workshop to develop an understanding of how technological methodologies are applied by geographers. I hope this experience will deepen my methodological questions through providing a new point of departure, and provide me with a foundation of knowledge concerning GIS that I can use to develop a proposal for integration of language analysis software developed by the UC Berkeley statnews.org lab with the GIS system to visualize linguistic trends in social media across space and time. 
Please visit http://statnews.org if you are interested in viewing the work of the UC Berkeley statnews.org lab. The lab is currently looking for partners to branch out into new fields of social science application, so if anyone is interested in discussing possible collaboration to enhance the computer science (language analysis and visualization) aspects of their research feel free to send me an email: luke@barnesmoore.com
